          A chronological age calculator is a utility tool that computes your
          age from birth to a given date. You can determine your chronological
          age by performing a simple calculation, that is, subtracting the date
          of birth from the date when asked. However, you don&#39;t need to
          apply this formula to obtain your age in the presence of this tool.
          Chronological age calculation is made easier with this advanced
          algorithmic tool.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our tool delivers accurate results, meaning it provides you with exact
          chronological age in years, months, and days format. Even while
          calculating for a leap year-born person, not a single day will miss
          from the age calculation process.
        </BoxContainer>
        <BoxContainer heading=" What is Chronological Age?">
          Firstly, you need to understand the definition of chronological order
          before differentiating age and chronological age. Chronological order
          is arranging or describing events that happened first to last between
          two given dates or intervals. <br /> <br />
          For instance, when you had to describe to someone the activities you
          have done during a weekend in chronological order, you should start
          listing from your first activity to the last without skipping one. It
          will let an audience look at a timeline clearly without missing
          valuable information.
          <br />
          <br />
          When we arrange dates in increasing order becomes a chronological
          date. Technically, age is a date. Hence, to determine your
          chronological age, you should start counting your age from the first
          given date (date of birth) to the last given date (the present day).
          <br />
          <span className="text-md my-4 block font-[100]">
            <i>
              Chronological order misses no events. Thus, while arranging dates
              in chronological order, we should always include days and months
              with the year.‚Äù
            </i>
          </span>
          <br /> Generally, we tell people our age in just years or the number
          of birthdays we have celebrated. The age we tell others in an informal
          way is our normal age. While chronological age is scribed in a formal
          manner in proper date, months, and years format so that not a single
          day will be missing from our age.
        </BoxContainer>
        <BoxContainer heading="  Need for Calculating Chronological Age">
          Why do we need to know our chronological age? Chronological age is
          necessary to partake in legal activities. It is always asked in
          government forms or by medical experts before continuing further
          process. <br /> <br />

              different countries for voting. Chronological age is essential to
              prevent the minor age group from participating in the election to
              maintain the quality of democracy.

        <BoxContainer heading="Appearance Age">
          Appearance age or perceived age describes how young you look.
          Scientifically, people look visually older as their chronological age
          increases. However, this is not the case with many individuals. Some
          people look 20 years old at their 30 while some look 40 years old at
          their 30. Estimating a person&#39;s age on the basis of their physical
          characteristics like look, beauty, personality, etc is appearance age.
          <br />
          <br />
          In this modern era, where people judge you on your looks, it is
          essential to know your appearance age. It provides a standard to
          estimate overall health conditions in the elder ones. Appearance age
          is crucial for fashion enthusiast models and cosmetics companies.

        <BoxContainer heading="Biological Age">
          Biological age, also known as Physiological age, indicates the
          functional capacity of the human body and how long a person will live.
          True Biological age is calculated with the help of biomarkers
          (Measurable Indicators of Biological State) in the process called
          biomarkers of aging.¬† <br /> <br />
          Medical evidence is required to measure Biological age. Your
          biological age may differ depending on your health condition, while
          chronological age is unalterable.¬† <br /> <br />
          Biological age is crucial to predict proneness to age-related diseases
          and lifespan as it provides precise standards. Your Biological age can
          be higher or lower than your chronological age and is totally
          controllable. You may become biologically younger by adopting a
          healthy lifestyle.

        <BoxContainer headingClass="w-full" heading="Mental Age">
          Mental age is a measure of intelligence performance level compared to
          average intelligence based on chronological age. The individual will
          be considered normal if his/her mental age is the same as
          chronological age. Mental age and chronological age provide a standard
          to measure the Intelligent quotient. <br />
          <br />
          The formula is IQ = MA/CA X 100
          <br />
          <br />
          Alfred Binet, a French psychologist, discovered the concept of mental
          age in 1905. Mental age is estimated based on a standardized mean
          score and a child&#39;s performance score on a traditional
          Neuropsychological or Intelligence test. For Instance, if the
          standardized mean score for 5 yrs child is 7/20, then 11 yrs child who
          scores 7/20 will have a mental age of 5 years.¬† <br />
          <br />
          Binet, with his colleague Theodore Simon, created the first
          Intelligence test in 1905. Later, Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman
          revised this test and created a new edition of the Intelligence test
          known as Stanford‚ÄìBinet Intelligence Scales in 1916. Today, it is
          widely used for¬†educational placement, career assessment, career
          assessment, and other purposes where psychological evidence is
          required. <br />
          <br />
          Mental age is frequently measured in child to determine reasoning,
          judging, and comprehending abilities, while it is less significant for
          adult as intelligence growth become slower.
        </BoxContainer>
        <BoxContainer heading="Functional Age">
          Functional age aims to examine the functional capacity of a person
          according to strength indexed based on chronological age. The
          Functional capacity includes both physical and mental functioning. The
          Functional age of a person with a disability is either not calculated
          or considered zero. <br />
          <br /> Functional age is important to determine if a person can
          perform specific work on the provided scale. Factors like stamina,
          speed, and agility come into consideration while measuring functional
          age. <br />
          <br />
          An employer can ask for functional age while hiring to ensure the
          candidate can perform assigned tasks according to given standards.
          Also, knowing your functional age can help you decide whether you
          should continue to work on jobs or get retired.
        </BoxContainer>
        <BoxContainer heading="Social Age">
          Social age checks a person&#39;s ability to participate in social
          engagement. The social age is more about behavior or interpersonal
          ability rather than logical ability.¬†
          <br />
